        <h1>To Clarissa,</h1>
        <p>
          As your friend, I can't stand by and not do anything when anything
          like this happens. I know that what has happened to you isn’t exactly
          something that you wanted coming. But life just throws things at you
          that you just don’t expect sometimes, you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I can say is that, I’m sure you didn’t do anything wrong at all.
          Like what I have always/will always tell you, don’t you ever be hard
          on yourself for anything. You’re absolutely perfect the way you are
          and no one should bring you down for anything. You’re one of the most
          wonderful people I know in my life ca, and I’m sure a lot of people
          think the same way too.
        </p>
        <p>
          As someone that swore to be your friend, I will never hesitate to
          listen to you about anything. I care about you a lot, you know, a lot
          of people do. Just know that I’ll always be here for you and I’ll
          always be on your side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, do what you have to do to be happy and keep up the good
          work for NNU, okay? You’re gonna win and come out on top. I just know
          that you will.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter the amount of heartaches and scars you have to endure, i
          know definitely that our Clarissa will be dancing and shining like she
          always does. This world’s all yours to take, show them what you’re
          made of!!
        </p>
